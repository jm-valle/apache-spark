Repository for Apache Spark Scripts

## Important Informations
This repository was made to show simple functions in a PySpark Script using MongoDB with the <b>IP: "10.7.40.39"</b>,the <b>database:"doacao_eleicoes"</b> and the <b>collection: "doacao_collection"</b>

<p>There is the possibility of using the codes in this repository without MongoDB, instead of the Spark Context in the scripts receiving the MongoDB connector parameter, it will read data directly from your computer.</p>
